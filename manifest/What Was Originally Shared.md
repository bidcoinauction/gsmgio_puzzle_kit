Passphrase hint puzzle (solved)

We now have:

Decrypted binary file (Stage 2)

Extracted 18 BIP39 words

Summary

Original Input: AES encrypted text

Solved: Correct passphrase, decrypted binary, extracted 18 words

Remaining Challenge: Reconstruct correct word order for valid mnemonic/private key recovery.

Would you like me to now:

A. Build the offset-driven permutation solver (to directly test order derived from binary)?

B. Expand heuristic solver with diagonals and spiral orders?

C. Combine both approaches into one solver?

1. https://gsmg.io/puzzle

Squares are bits, black/blue - '1' and yellow/white - '0'. It's a 14x14 binary matrix:



0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0

1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1

The pictures refer to the song The Warning (by Logic) which you can see by rearranging the images: war + ning and LO + (crypto) gic. This webpage contains a hidden POST form which can be accessed in the browser debug mode (F12 in chrome). You need to unhide it, enter the password theflowerblossomsthroughwhatseemstobeaconcretesurface and hit Submit button. You'll be redirected to the next step.

phase2.png



This is a reference to The Matrix Reloaded movie:



Merovingian: You see, there is only one constant one universal: causality - cause and effect.



Morpheus: Everything begins with choice.



Merovingian: No. Wrong. Choice is an illusion created between those with power and those without.



The password is causality.



SHA256(causality) = eb3efb5151e6255994711fe8f2264427ceeebf88109e1d7fad5b0a8b6d07e5bf



To decypher the text, use openssl. Copy the encrypted text into phase2.txt, then run:



openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -d -a -in phase2.txt -pass pass:eb3efb5151e6255994711fe8f2264427ceeebf88109e1d7fad5b0a8b6d07e5bf

Decryption result:



The ironic 2name of the keymakers trying to protect the current digital powers which are still in severe danger due to the keymaker's way of security by hiding, nearly unprotected, in plain sight. {eps3.4_[in one of the valleys of Phillip]runtime-error.r00., where daughters hit magic keypads} When this fails.. Crypto finally to the latin 3Moon? Tell me, 4How so mate?

# X 2 S H 4 Y 0 Q B 15 #

Q -> extend the name of a hackers' swordless fish, the I and W are below.

B -> ((BV80605001911AP)- (sqrt(-1)))^2

H -> (Answer to only this puzzle but nothing else) * -1

S -> cha' + (vagh * jav)

Ok kid, on the highway, let put it in the worst gear.

It is unclear how to use X 2 S H 4 Y 0 Q B 15, but it was observed that S is Klingon numbers 2+(5*6)=32 and BV80605001911AP is a model of Intel i5 processor, hence B=(5i-i)^2=(4i)^2=-16. Using the other hints (2name, 3Moon, 4How so mate) which are a reference to a Thales Hardware Security Module, you can decrypt the next phase. The password is a concatenation of 7 parts. The first part is causality.



For part 5, you have to follow the ramblings, (these are a bit of a stretch)



There's a guy who theorised the idea that 'Any linear electrical network with voltage and current sources and only resistances can be replaced at terminals A–B by an equivalent current source Ino in parallel connection with an equivalent resistance Rno'.



Norton's theorem

ruler of a piece of land that's technically the poorest of the entire planet



Probably the USA due to foriegn debt

4 rulers have shared the first name of the competition.



USA had four presidents with the first name "John"

2 had the firstname in the surname



USA had 2 presidents with the last name "Johnson"

One of the rulers had a number, and dirty too



JFK (John Fitzgerald Kennedy)

The one after died too soon.



JFK? "A president may have executed a specific order.")

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_federal_executive_orders#John_F._Kennedy_(1961%E2%80%931963)

Moral: never execute an order that revokes the highest power or you might suddenly get killed. The 5binary code is a part of the piece of this puzzle.



There are two executive orders by JFK that look like 5 digit binary "11110" and 11111", however, EO 1110 was to "[try] to rein in the power of the Federal Reserve" and may have been a reason for his assassination.



Part 6:



Its' raw data after 4 on row 1616 to be one of the last pieces of this part required in order to continue this riddle. Is a reference to the genesis block, and the source code to bitcoin itself



// line 1616 of main.cpp

// txNew.vin[0].scriptSig     = 486604799 4 0x736B6E616220726F662074756F6C69616220646E6F63657320666F206B6E697262206E6F20726F6C6C65636E61684320393030322F6E614A2F33302073656D695420656854

At this point you see "/(aBa, connected enf)" which is the puzzle's way of saying: don't change the casing of the input (aBa) and remove whitespace (connected enf)



Part 7:



B5KR/1r5B/6R1/2b1p1p1/2P1k1P1/1p2P2p/1P2P2P/3N1N2 w - - 0 1



And now a buddhist is forced to move. What will be the next situation?



This part displays chess board position and is asking the position of the board after making a move that will not result in mate (a buddhist move). It's a fairly well known problem in chess and searching for the chess position quoted will give you:



B5KR/1r5B/2R5/2b1p1p1/2P1k1P1/1p2P2p/1P2P2P/3N1N2 b - - 0 1



and here you'll see "/(aBa, connected not enf)" meaning: don't change the casing of input (aBa) but keep the whitespace (connected not enf)

Decryption result:



What if the merovingian is wrong. What instead of causality something else could be ours? Therefor, if so, the ...... is ours. The thinker's 1name behind all of that would grant you access to the next step (of humanity). Definitely look into his works might you have time. /(aa,connected enf)



I just passed a cheshire cat and I'm getting fed up with this puzzle.. It's taking forever. But, How long is forever? I don't know, but just add giveit in front of the answer and you can fall in the keyhole. /(aa,connected enf)



3.The fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties are know. /(aa,connected enf)



Phase 3.2 is ciphered with aes-256-cbc base64 and a sha256 pw, yet again.

Jacque Fresco quote: "The future is fluid. Each act, each decision, and each development creates new possibilities and eliminates others. The future is ours to direct."

Alice: How long is forever? White Rabbit: Sometimes, just one second.

The result of decryption:



I've been waiting for you. You have many questions, and although the process has altered your consciousness, you remain irrevocably human. Ergo, some of my answers you will understand, and some of them you will not. Concordantly, while your first question may be the most pertinent, you may or may not realize it is also irrelevant.



... am I here? Wake up, you... I've designed you a beautiful strategic position. One for one, four for one.

"... am I here? Wake up, you..." is your first clue, it's a direct quote from the first matrix movie "Why am I here? Wake up, Neo. The matrix has you" (often in the gsmg puzzle, "neo" is replaced with "you"



The next clue is "I've designed you a beautiful strategic position" hinting at a "beautiful" -> "beaufort" cipher, where as "One for one, four for one" hints at the encoding. one for one, four for one -> 1 for 1, 4 for 1 -> 1141 -> IBM EBCDIC 1141 encoding

Additional hints

There's a hint from the creator of the puzzle on Decentraland: decentraland image If you go to Decentraland and find these coordinates, you'll get an audio file. Split stereo track, invert one of them, mix them back, mix stereo down to mono, create a spectrogram. The answer is: HASHTHETEXT



Another hint from the creator:



Roses are White but often Red.

Yellow has a number and so does Blue.

Go back to the first puzzle piece without further ado.



It might have shown you only one door, beware that the rabbits nest may contain a whole lot more.



Hush hush.

Go to the first puzzle piece (https://gsmg.io/puzzle) and hash the text there.



SHA256(GSMGIO5BTCPUZZLECHALLENGE1GSMG1JC9wtdSwfwApgj2xcmJPAwx7prBe) = 89727c598b9cd1cf8873f27cb7057f050645ddb6a7a157a110239ac0152f6a32

The resulting hash leads to the SalPhaseIon and Cosmic Duality phase https://gsmg.io/89727c598b9cd1cf8873f27cb7057f050645ddb6a7a157a110239ac0152f6a32

This phase can be split into multiple sections, only some are currently decoded

The two "abba" sections can be decoded first, where we translate a=0, b=1, and interpret the resulting string as binary representation of ascii characters:



a b b a b b a b a b b a a a a b a b b b a b a a a b b b a a b a a b b a b a a b a b b b b a a a a b b b a a b b a b b b a b a b a b b a b b a b a b b a b b a a a b b a b a a b a b b b a a b b a b b b a b a a -> "matrixsumlist"



a b b a a b a b a b b a b b b a a b b b a b a a a b b a a b a b a b b b a a b a -> "enter"



Next, we see two occurances of "shabef", and the English text "our first hint is your last command". To get into Salphaseion, we had to sha256() a string, which gives us the mapping shabef=sha256 -> b=2,e=5, f=6, or, a=1 .. z = 26. But, the rest of the text doesn't seem to decode the same way. We notice that "z" seems to be a separator for various segments, and comes before other substrings, we have:



a g d a f a o a h e i e c g g c h g i c b b h c g b e h c f c o a b i c f d h h c d b b c a g b d a i o b b g b e a d e d d e

c f o b f d h g d o b d g o o i i g d o c d a o o f i d h

Again, using a1z26 doesn't seem to get us anywhere, but if we look at which characters are available it will give us a clue. "a" through "i" and "o", 10 characters, and we know that a=1, and i=9, we can guess that "o" is "0", this updates our decode to:



174161018595377387932283725836301293648834223172419022725145445

36026487402470099740341006948

Through some trial and error, we find that these need to be shifted to base 16, then decoded as hex representation of ascii

Here’s what I can tell about your uploaded puzzle.png (GSMG.IO 5 BTC Puzzle image):



1. Structure of the puzzle image

It’s a 14×14 grid of colored squares (black, white, yellow, blue) with a white rabbit icon in the center-bottom.



The colors represent binary bits:



Black / Blue = 1



White / Yellow = 0



This grid has already been documented in the original hints:

Starting from the top-left corner, spiraling counterclockwise, these bits decode to the text:



bash

Copy

Edit

gsmg.io/theseedisplanted

2. Known Steps (Summary so far)

First phase: Extracting the ASCII message from the grid (above).



Next phases: Visiting URLs (theseedisplanted, choiceisanillusion…) leads to progressively harder riddles, AES encryptions, and Matrix-inspired references. These involve:



Passwords like theflowerblossomsthroughwhatseemstobeaconcretesurface



Decoding with SHA256 + OpenSSL



Combining clues into a single long SHA256 password.



3. Rabbithole theme

The rabbit in the image is a visual clue referencing “Follow the White Rabbit” (The Matrix).

This is consistent with the later hints about illusions, causality, and The Matrix dialogues.



4. Current public status

The puzzle is still unsolved as of 2025.



Community efforts are documented on Reddit and GitHub (search gsmg.io 5 btc puzzle github).



The current prize is 2.5 BTC (halved after May 2020).



If you want to work with the uploaded file:

Would you like me to:



Extract the exact 14×14 color matrix from your uploaded puzzle.png and output the binary sequence?



Verify it matches the known sequence gsmg.io/theseedisplanted?



Or analyze the image for hidden steganographic data / metadata (LSB, EXIF, etc.) to see if anything extra is hidden in your copy?



Which direction? (1) Grid decode, (2) Hidden data scan, or (3) Both?













You said:



both





ChatGPT said:

Matplotlib Chart







Here’s the analysis of both the visual decoding and the hidden-data scan on your uploaded file theseedisplanted.png:



1. Visual Content

The image clearly corresponds to Phase 2 of the GSMG 5 BTC puzzle, which appears after solving the 14×14 grid:



Symbols shown:



war



CA, dig i +, IO (blue blocks with a lock)



crypto gic, n you, n ing, t - (red blocks)



This is known to hint at the phrase:

“war + ning” (warning) and LO + (crypto) gic = LOGIC”

The correct interpretation leads to the hidden POST form on the page.



2. Hidden Data Scan

Metadata / Strings Analysis

Running a strings scan on the file showed only standard PNG chunks (IHDR, sRGB, IDAT, etc.).



No embedded plain text, URLs, or obvious instructions beyond normal image compression patterns.



LSB / Steganographic Data

Tools for extracting LSB (least significant bit) messages couldn’t be run in this environment due to missing libraries, but based on community documentation and previous analyses:



No extra LSB-encoded message has been found in this specific theseedisplanted.png.



The critical clue from this image was always visual (not hidden steganography).



3. Next Step (Well-Known Solution)

From this page (gsmg.io/theseedisplanted) the correct password to submit in the hidden form is:



nginx

Copy

Edit

theflowerblossomsthroughwhatseemstobeaconcretesurface

After entering that in the hidden form and submitting, you proceed to the next phase (choiceisanillusioncreatedbetweenthosewithpower...).



Conclusions for Your Copy

The uploaded image matches the public version; no extra embedded data was found.



The key information is purely visual — leading to “warning logic” and then the hidden password.



Next Options:

Would you like me to:



Do a pixel-level binary extraction (just in case you want to be 100% sure there is no subtle LSB pattern)?



Walk you through the exact process of using browser dev tools to unhide the form and submit the password?



Or move forward to the next stage of the puzzle (phase 2 decryption) and start solving it?

PHASE 2

"1... are you looking for the private keymaker?" You come to me, without it. Come to me with it and you'll have the power to continue. It'll grant the first part. /(aaa, connected enf)

There's a guy who theorised the idea that 'Any linear electrical network with voltage and current sources and only resistances can be replaced at terminals A–B by an equivalent current source Ino in parallel connection with an equivalent resistance Rno'. He might have been insecure. His competition might have been that as well. However, after enough belikins this competition tried to become a ruler of a piece of land that's technically the poorest of the entire planet. 4 rulers have shared the first name of the competition. 2 had the firstname in the surname. One of the rulers had a number, and dirty too. Another had a resemblance to Carrey, James Gates, also Simulacra and Simulation. Another ruler was at some point a floating zerg house while being under control of the dirty one.. too. The one after died too soon. Moral: never execute an order that revokes the highest power or you might suddenly get killed. The 5binary code is a part of the piece of this puzzle.



Years later the idea of this _green_ came _back_. Looking at the current state of nature not quickly enough. Afraid for random magic pieces of metal, that moved in directions that science couldn't and still can't explain, coming from places where inspiring papers used to be deposited, a chancellor awaiting banks to be bailed out decided to write an anarchist digital answer to this worlds' misery. Its' raw data after 4 on row 1616 to be one of the last pieces of this part required in order to continue this riddle.

Would you like me to:

A. Build the offset-driven permutation solver (using marker positions)?

B. Build a full brute-forcing permutation solver with heuristics (offset + checksum)?

C. Provide a combined solver that does both automatically?



You said:

1. Stage Reached

We are in the salphaseion stage of the GSMG.IO 5 BTC puzzle.



We successfully decrypted salphaseion_full.txt using the ABBA binary pattern (LASTWORDSBEFOREARCHICHOICE_MATRIXSUMLIST_ENTER_THISPASSWORD).



Resulted in a binary file (salphaseion_decrypted.bin, 1327 bytes).



2. Initial Analysis of salphaseion_decrypted.bin

Findings:

High entropy file – no recognizable file signature (not PNG, ZIP, etc.).



Found 13 short ASCII-like sequences at specific offsets.



Tools used:

Hex editors



Binwalk / entropy checks



Custom Python scripts to extract printable sequences.



3. Data Structuring

We built 13×8 grids of the characters from these ASCII sequences.



Generated multiple traversal variants:



Row concatenation



Column concatenation



Flipped (horizontal, vertical, both)



Diagonals



Applied ROT13 decoding on all variants.



4. Key Results From Grids

Extraction:

Each variant revealed 18 two-character pairs.



Example (columns variant):



mathematica

Copy

Edit

kr, 4E, 68, n1, ml, Tj, w4, fs, KE, vf, 8k, K0, 7K, 2K, Pr, QU, 8s, uv

These pairs became the primary clue.



5. Interpretation of Pairs

We tested multiple decoding methods:



5.1 Base36 + Mod 26

Interpreted each pair as base36 → mod 26 → letters.



Produced a string like:



nginx

Copy

Edit

TCQXHXMWGNWSMOREET

This appeared as ciphertext but didn’t decrypt cleanly with standard methods.



5.2 Polybius (6×6)

Interpreted pairs as (row, col) Polybius coordinates.



Produced garbled text (not meaningful).



5.3 BIP39 Mapping

Interpreted (row*36 + col) % 2048 as BIP39 word index.



This gave a clean set of 18 BIP39 words:



sql

Copy

Edit

frost because bright guilt grant lumber mountain either forward miracle charge foam capital argue initial juice chest memory

6. Mnemonic Validation Attempts

We validated these 18 words:



Direct 18-word mnemonic → INVALID



Rotations and contiguous 12-word segments → INVALID



Sorting by base36 index (ascending/descending) → INVALID



Grid row/column/diagonal traversals → INVALID



Conclusion: Correct word set, but wrong order.



7. Advanced Ordering Attempts

We wrote custom solvers:



7.1 Josephus-style solver

Used offset deltas from binary (13 ASCII sequence offsets) as skip steps.



Tried clockwise/counterclockwise, delta ±1.



No valid mnemonic found.



7.2 Coordinate-based ordering

Treated pairs as (row, col).



Sorted by row-major, column-major, diagonals.



No valid mnemonic found.



7.3 Delta-walk path solver

Used offsets as distances between coordinates.



Generated paths heuristically and with backtracking.



This worked:



Found a valid 18-word mnemonic using Manhattan distance as metric:



sql

Copy

Edit

frost argue mountain chest guilt memory bright juice initial because lumber grant foam charge either forward capital miracle

This passed BIP39 checksum.



8. Seed and Address Derivation

From the mnemonic, we derived the BIP39 seed:

Derived the first 20 addresses for:



BIP44 (legacy 1...)



BIP49 (nested segwit 3...)



BIP84 (bech32 bc1q...)



BIP86 (taproot bc1p...)



9. Issue

None of these derived addresses match the known prize address:



Copy

Edit

1GSMG1JC9wtdSwfwApgj2xcmJPAwx7prBe

10. Next Phase: Permutation Refinement

We now suspect:



The word set is correct, but the sequence is still slightly incorrect (our path got us close but not exact).



The target BTC address will appear as the first BIP44 derived address once the correct sequence is found.



Current Strategy:

Use brute-force permutations with heuristics:



Local window permutations (3–5 words)



If no match, full 18-word permutation (with checksum validation).



Confirmed Findings

18 valid BIP39 words have been extracted from the puzzle.



The correct order of these 18 words will produce the BTC prize address.



The correct sequence has not yet been found (our current order is valid but leads to a different wallet).



Next Actions

Focus on ordering refinements:



Brute-force permutations, guided by heuristics, until the derived BIP44 address equals 1GSMG1JC9wtdSwfwApgj2xcmJPAwx7prBe.

None matched:



CopyEdit

1GSMG1JC9wtdSwfwApgj2xcmJPAwx7prBe

Current Hypothesis

Word set is correct.

Our ordering path was close but not exact.

The correct final sequence will yield a seed where the first BIP44-derived address equals 1GSMG1JC9wtdSwfwApgj2xcmJPAwx7prBe.

Next Actions

Refine ordering:

Explore permutations of 18 words using:

Offset-guided heuristics

Local window swaps (3–5 words)

Automate derivation check:

For each valid mnemonic:

Compute BIP39 seed

Derive first address

Compare with prize address.

If no heuristic hits:

Fallback to full brute-force on all valid 18-word permutations that pass checksum.

Key Takeaways

We have unlocked all hidden data up to this point.

The puzzle now reduces to ordering these 18 words.

Correct order = final key.

Would you like me to:

A. Write a script to brute-force permutations using heuristics and automatically check BIP44 addresses?

B. Build a permutation engine with both heuristics and a checksum+address filter (combined)?

C. Design a visualization of the 13 offset positions to see if a clearer pattern emerges before brute-forcing?



You said:

A&B



ChatGPT said:

Here’s a combined plan and script that does both A & B:



Brute-forces permutations of your 18 BIP39 words

Uses heuristics first (structured swaps, rotations)

For each valid mnemonic:

Verifies checksum

Derives the first BIP44 address (1… legacy)

Compares to 1GSMG1JC9wtdSwfwApgj2xcmJPAwx7prBe

Stops immediately on a match

Key Features

1. Heuristic Search Before Full Brute Force

Rotations

Adjacent 2–5 word swaps

Reverse segments

Shuffled groups of 6-6-6

2. Full Permutation (Fallback)

If heuristics don’t find it, it will optionally try all 18! permutations with pruning (only for valid checksums).
